I've started a modded Minecraft server running on one of my ThinkPads (T440s). The version is 1.19.2. To join, use the link [here](https://lainpilled.com/minecraft.html). You'll also need to download [Forge 1.19.2](https://lainpilled.com/music/forge-1.19.2-43.3.0-installer.jar) and my [mods](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YdVTJt-12UnipmF_Roc9fBV9dHfd3xXX?usp=sharing), which you can find here.
