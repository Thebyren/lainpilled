My new Minecraft server is now up and running on my main computer, so technical limitations shouldn't be an issue. It's a 1.21 vanilla server, and there's no barrier to entry. Simply use the server address provided on the links page. For more information or to chat with others, join my Discord server (also linked on the links page).
